Some of you may have noticed [my post](https://twitter.com/andreasgies/status/474564890964000768/photo/1) the other day and may have wondered what
is going on. Well in short, the Way of Quality is about to shift it's attention slightly. I have been in consulting for more than 20 years and in
that time I have seen all kinds of projects - different sizes, different technologies, different strategies, different budgets. I have provided
architecture consulting, development and project management.

Looking back, I am best at working with small teams as a lead developer - working with the business to capture testable requirements and working with
the fellow developers to realize a project that has a maintainable architecture and is fun to work with technology wise. This is not to say I am bad
at project management or sole architect consulting - I am just better at the hybrid role.

This having said, within that role I have noticed a trend - also at enterprise level customers that I usually work with - towards open source
technologies. A change that I do more than welcome from the bottom of my heart. I was lucky in the last couple of years to be involved with
many open source projects - [Active MQ](http://activemq.apache.org), [Apache Camel](http://camel.apache.org), [Apache Karaf](http://karaf.apache.org),
[Akka](http://akka.io),[HawtIO](http://hawt.io) - just to name a few. However, due to certain roles I had during my time as an employee, I was
still involved with legacy technologies.

As a result, one important aspect for the future of the _Way of Quality_ is

## More Open Source engagement

I have noticed, that being involved with legacy technologies kind of distracts from other things. It is not easy to blog about those technologies due
to license restrictions. Even if blogging would be fine - the audience of such articles is rather limited and most likely will become even more limited
over the next 2 years or so.

As a consequence, the _Way of Quality_ will shift it's focus to fully embrace the Open Source challenges. The _Way of Quality_ will primarily continue to invest in the recently published [Project Blended](/projects/blended) as this is the foundation for most of the current projects. There is a lot to do in terms of abstracting components out of existing projects into _open source_-consumable components and proper documentation.

In that context we will continue to contribute to the open source projects we are using as a foundation whenever we come across something that fits into those projects better than into our own framework.

## Speaking slots

**Open Source is about sharing.** Even though I am completely aware of that fact I have let my time been eaten up by project work. Even if I had accomplished miracles in my project (I doubt I have) nobody would know.

Making the shift towards open source also means to go to more conferences, compete for speaking slots and try to get into discussions with the users of the technologies I use or contribute to.

Hope to see some of you over the next year or so ...

## Selected customer projects

It might be clear at this point, we will focus on projects that are open source related and where we can contribute on a technical level rather than in project management. With the communication facilities available to the modern society we believe in distributed teams and will be looking for projects
that have a similar mind set.

To our experience working in a distributed team can actually help to keep the communication up and focused. Also for a team to work in a distributed
fashion efficiently, the development processes must support that kind of working style. For example, an accessible code repository must be available - most companies don't use a public server, but host their own repositories. Also, continuous integration processes must be implemented.

In the last decade or so I have worked with many teams to streamline their development processes and effectively become more distributed as the demand on response times to requirement changes became tight and tighter.

The Way of Quality will work with projects that want to move into that direction and provide a mix of on- and off-site consulting. We will definitely **not participate in body leasing** as there are more than enough of that kind of consulting companies providing this kind of consulting. Rather we will work with the projects with the goal in mind to transfer the knowledge into the project to become self sufficient. Yes - that may take some time, but at some point it will happen.

## Training

A large part of our efforts will become teaching efforts. Basic trainings in the technologies used in the project, team building exercises, architecture workshops and methodology trainings.

### How not to train

In the past I have given many trainings - and most of them on site - in order to save travel costs. **Let's face it: This is not how a training works.**

* Most days the training starts late as the participants drop by their work desk before coming to the training room. In 90% of the cases there is something
that absolutely can't wait until after the the training.
* Even worse is conducting a training in the clients normal office (Yes - I have done it....need to eat ;)). The phone is ringing constantly, the room is not meant for trainings and normally at least one participant is busy with other stuff.
* Even within the training room concentration is not necessarily with the training. On most days at least one participant spends his time waiting for the next break to get back to his desk to *fix something*. Some training rooms have access to the company's network - in that case they will be fixing *right there* rather than listening to things that might actually lessen the need for *ad hoc* fixes.

I'll admit this sounds bad, but I have seen it all. I am rather convinced that the human mind is more or less single threaded. Listening to training trying to process the information **and** at the same time trying to do the day-to-day job doesn't work at all.

### How to train

Training is all about absorbing new information, new concepts or optimize concepts already known. In any case it is a mental challenge to change something in the day to day behavior (applying ne knowledge is also a change).

To achieve such a thing the mind must be open to the challenge and the more it is kept within the boundaries of the day job the less new knowledge can be absorbed.

**So, we are convinced that in order to train efficiently**

* You have to get out of your day job for the time of the training. This is best achieved by physically going somewhere else with the intention to learn new stuff.
* Even if it sounds a bit non-technical: Mind and Body belong together - you can't learn in an environment where you feel uncomfortable. It is best to train in a comfortable location. If the body feels rested, the mind does so as well and can learn more efficiently.
* The state of mind decides how well new knowledge can be absorbed. Are you open to new things - are you afraid of encountering new technologies ? - We believe that a calm mind is more capable of meeting the challenges of change. This has nothing to do with technology at all - it has to do with personality: if you feel fit for new challenges they won't frighten you.

### Yoga and Training

Why am I elaborating about all these things? - A couple of years back I came across [Sivananda Yoga](https://www.sivananda.org/) and meanwhile we at _Way of Quality_ are certified Yoga teachers.

We are convinced, that with the help of even a minimal Yoga practice the mind and body can get into a state where learning becomes a simple exercise. At the core of all the changes that will happen over the next year or so we intend to offer courses with a mix of Yoga and technology.

Participants will benefit from a daily Yoga routine, a vegetarian diet and a beautiful location - all of which will reduce the stress to learn all the new things that will be coming up in daily project life. We have seen ourselves that being together with a single goal in mind, sharing not only the technology lectures, but also breakfast, diner and Yoga classes will increase the group's energy, so that achieving the same learning goals as in traditionally organized courses will not require 8 hours of classes each day.

This having said I will come back to my introductory reference to my [earlier post](https://twitter.com/andreasgies/status/474564890964000768/photo/1). We are currently preparing to open a training center in [Andalusia, Spain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andalusia) that will be the home base for our training courses and remote project work.

**Hope to see you there at some point.**
