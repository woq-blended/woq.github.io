I have been a happy [Joomla](http://www.joomla.org/) user for a while, but somehow it wasn't quite what I felt at home with for editing my content. Especially editing articles with source code references and pictures in it didn't resonate with me very well. With getting more active on [github](http://github.com/woq) I came across github-pages and Jekyll, a blog aware generator for static web pages.

Playing with it for a couple of days, the [Way of Quality homepage](http://www.wayofquality.de) has now a new dress and publishing content is merely a git push. I will be busy over the next couple of days to move my project documentation to the new location as well. Looking forward to share more content faster.

A special thanks goes to [Hossain Mohd Faysal](mailto:hmfaysal@alum.mit.edu) for providing a [jekyll theme](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/hmfaysal-omega-theme/) that made it very simple to get the transition done with a minimal headache. All errors that may still be on the web page are my own faults and not attributed to the template. __Thanks, Hossain !__
