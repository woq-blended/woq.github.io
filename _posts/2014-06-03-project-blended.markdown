With the transition to Jekyll we have decided that the documentation for our project **[de.woq.osgi.java](https://github.com/woq/de.woq.osgi.java)** should become Jekyll driven pages as well. As **de.woq.osgi.java** is a rather silly name for a project, we have decided to rename it to **Blended**.

The new documentation location is at [http://www.wayofquality.de/projects/blended/](http://www.wayofquality.de/projects/blended/). We hope the documentation becomes easier to read and navigate by transitioning to the new site and be able to share even better.

In that sense, **de.woq.osgi.java** is dead, long live project **Blended** ...

_Note: The technical bits of renaming everything under the covers will take a couple of days._
