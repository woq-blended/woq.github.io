# [Project Blended](blended/index.html)

## Formerly de.woq.osgi.java

A collection of reusable bundles to be used as a foundation for developing OSGi based applications. Choosing the project name was intentional: As much as a blended whhiskey brings togehter the flavours of the ingredients to a unique experience, this project brings a combination of open source projects into a single container and takes away the low level details of getting the configuration correct that is required to have a workable OSGi container in the first place.

In other words, it aims to be the equivalent of a really good blended whiskey in software.

_Note: This project is still on github with its old name __de.woq.osgi.java__ The project will be renamed over the course of the next few days._
